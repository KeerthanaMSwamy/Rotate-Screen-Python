# Rotate-Screen-Python

This is a python project I did to play a prank on one of my friends
so here are a few steps to run this on yours or your friend's computer 
1. Install rotate screen module by:" pip install rotate-screen " in your terminal 
2. copy the code or better download the zip file and run 
3. I use VS CODE and I highly recommend it 
4. The screen starts rotating continuously and to stop it click [ ctrl+f2]
5. If your friend does not know how to stop the execution of code, he/she/they have to restart their computer
